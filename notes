Our Origins

Dereck Farnsworth first started and still currently runs Complete Maintenance and Repair in order to improve 
buildings and homes by constructing remodels and renovations, and also do things like build decks, porches, 
walls, and much more. We started off by serving customers in the local Bentonville area. As we grew, we have
expanded to serve clients in all of Northwest Arkansas. We have always strived to make sure our clients are 
satisfied throughout our journey.
